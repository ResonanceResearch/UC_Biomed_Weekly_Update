This randomized controlled trial assessed pre‐ and postoperative patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and knee joint gait biomechanics for UKA and TKA patients. Patients were allocated to UKA (Oxford Partial Knee, Biomet, USA) and TKA (Persona CR Knee System, Zimmer, USA) study arms. Patients completed the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Western Ontario &amp; McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC), as well as instrumented gait analysis before and 1‐year after surgery. Measures of interest: OKS scores; WOMAC sub‐scores; Patient‐specific correlations and root mean squared errors (RMSE) of stance phase sagittal and coronal knee angles. Statistical analysis included linear mixed‐effects models (PROMs; α = 0.0125) and multivariate analysis of variance (gait biomechanics; α = 0.05). A total of 38 patients were recruited (UKA n = 17; TKA n = 21). All PROMs improved significantly following surgery ( n = 37, p &lt; 0.001), regardless of surgical technique. A significant effect of surgical technique on gait biomechanics was observed ( n = 30, F 4,25 , p = 0.010), where UKA patients displayed greater sagittal plane correlations [median(Q1,Q3) UKA 0.985 (0.967, 0.991), TKA 0.955 (0.942, 0.973)]; p = 0.018] and lower coronal plane RMSEs [UKA 3.6 (2.4,5.0)°, TKA 8.6 (5.1, 11.5)°; p = 0.002]. Although patient‐reported outcomes improved similarly following UKA and TKA, UKA more closely preserved native knee kinematics as indicated by the greater similarity of sagittal gait patterns shapes and lower magnitude of coronal angle changes. Clinical Significance Greater preservation of patient‐specific knee kinematics with UKA supports its use in appropriately selected patients and informs the design of targeted, functionally oriented rehabilitation protocols.",

We examined sex differences in the frequency and severity of BPSD in patients with AD living in long-term care homes (LTCH) or admitted to inpatient psychiatric units. Methods: Data were obtained from the Standardizing Care for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life in Dementia (StaN) study (ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03672201). BPSD were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C), and symptom clusters were clustered as: (1) psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), (2) emotional distress cluster A (depression and anxiety), (3) emotional distress cluster B (depression, anxiety, and apathy), and (4) agitation (agitation, aggression, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, and aberrant vocalizations). Sex differences in frequency and severity of individual BPSD, and clusters were compared using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests and generalized linear models while controlling for age and place of residence. Results: Females had higher frequency (males=21.7% vs females=42.9%, X2=8.83, N=174, p=0.003), and greater severity of delusions ((mean (SD) males=51.87 (44.15), mean (SD) females=67.93 (70.53), U=2924, N=174, p=0.002)), U=2901.50, N=174, p=0.06)). Males had higher frequency (males=51.8% vs females=27.5%, X2=10.80, N=174, p=0.001) and greater severity of sleep disorders ((mean (SD) males=2.94 (4.21), mean (SD) females=1.76 (3.92), U=2885.50, N=174, p=0.002)). After controlling for age and residence, sex differences remained significant for delusions (Wald X2=3.97, N=176, p=0.046), but not for sleep disorders. There were no sex differences in the frequency or severity of any BPSD clusters Conclusions: We observed sex differences in the frequency and severity of specific BPSD. Future studies should aim to understand potential mechanisms underlying these differences, and to study their relevance in screening, and for individualized sex-specific management of BPSD.",
      "abstract_snippet_250w": "Introduction: Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) are highly prevalent in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). We examined sex differences in the frequency and severity of BPSD in patients with AD living in long-term care homes (LTCH) or admitted to inpatient psychiatric units. Methods: Data were obtained from the Standardizing Care for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life in Dementia (StaN) study (ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03672201). BPSD were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C), and symptom clusters were clustered as: (1) psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), (2) emotional distress cluster A (depression and anxiety), (3) emotional distress cluster B (depression, anxiety, and apathy), and (4) agitation (agitation, aggression, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, and aberrant vocalizations).

      "abstract_text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent heart arrhythmia, characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm and the absence of identifiable P waves on ECG. Given the loss of effective atrial contraction, AF carries a risk of serious complications. If untreated, AF can promote thrombogenesis, leading to stroke, systemic embolism (e.g., limb or organ ischemia), and myocardial infarction. These serious complications highlight the importance of understanding AF and assessing stroke risk to guide optimal management of this chronic arrhythmia. Congruent with recent technological developments, advanced imaging has emerged as a modality to better understand AF. This review highlights advanced imaging techniques and their advantages, with a focus on 4D flow MRI, a novel modality that enables visualization of blood flow patterns in three dimensions and provides unique insights into cardiac hemodynamics. It also synthesizes the current literature on key hemodynamic markers identified by 4D flow MRI, including blood flow stasis, wall shear stress, and vorticity. Quantifying these markers has improved predictive accuracy of future stroke risk in AF patients, allowing clinicians to risk stratifying their patients and optimize management. Finally, the review discusses potential future markers that may further refine our understanding of AF and inform patient care.",

While HER2’s role in breast cancer metastasis and prognosis is well-documented, its heterogeneity in brain metastases (BM) across different primary tumors remains understudied. This investigation examined HER2 status in matched primary cancers and BM across multiple cancer types to evaluate HER2 alterations during metastases. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 185 matched primary tumor-BM pairs. HER2 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), with equivocal cases (IHC 2+) further evaluated by silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH). We analyzed associations between HER2 positivity, clinicopathological factors, and survival outcomes. RESULTS Of the 185 matched cases, lung, breast, and colorectal cancers were predominant, with breast cancer showing the highest HER2 positivity rate (61.5%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). HER2 positivity was detected in 14.1% (26/185) of primary tumors and 15.1% (28/185) of BM with a 7.6% (14/185) discordance rate between primary and metastatic sites. HER2 positivity in BM significantly correlated with age, primary cancer type, and BM location (P = 0.040, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P = 0.045, respectively). Age, BM location, BM size, BM multiplicity, and presence of other organ metastases were identified as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION Our findings reveal significant HER2 heterogeneity between primary tumors and matched BM across cancer types. The observed discordance in HER2 status, particularly notable in breast cancer, underscores the necessity of HER2 status reassessment in BM for optimal targeted treatment strategies.",

Additionally, HIE is the most common cause of seizures during the acute neonatal period. Unfortunately, predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes and epilepsy risk is difficult in this population, and seizure burden during the acute period has not consistently been correlated with outcomes in prior studies. We aimed to examine EEG background data to determine whether there is a relationship between background abnormalities, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and epilepsy risk, and whether this information is more informative for predicting outcomes compared to other clinical data points. Methods Patients were retrospectively recruited from level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU's) in Calgary, Alberta, from 2014 to 2020. All patients who met the criteria for therapeutic hypothermia after being classified as at risk for HIE were included in the study. Clinical information captured included measures from clinical examination, blood work, MRI (day 3–5, scored using Barkovich scoring system) and medications. Continuous video EEG (cvEEG) recordings were separated into day 1, 2, and 3, and separate classifications systems were used for background and ictal findings. Neurodevelopmental follow-up was completed at two years of age, and patients were also categorized as having no epilepsy, or either well-controlled or refractory epilepsy. Poisson regression models and relative risk were used to compare background and ictal scores to long term neurodevelopmental outcomes and future epilepsy risk. Three supervised learning algorithms were trained to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes based on clinical factors. Results Two-hundred and six patients were eligible for the study. Among neonates with seizures, only 18% developed epilepsy, while 52% of those with severely abnormal EEG background patterns did. Total ictal burden was not significantly associated with epilepsy at follow up, and no antiseizures medications were significant predictors. In contrast, EEG background score was strongly associated with epilepsy risk (adjusted ß = 2.75, p = 0.002), with severely abnormal backgrounds conferring significantly increased risk (37.5% vs. 5.2%, RR = 7.22, 95% CI: 3.09–16.88). Similarly, ictal burden did not predict poor neurodevelopmental outcome or death, whereas background score was a strong predictor (adjusted ß = 1.74, p &amp;lt; 0.001; RR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.70–3.50). Machine learning models identified background features as more predictive than ictal scores, with XGBoost achieving the best classification performance (accuracy 0.724) and random forest yielding the highest AUC (0.751). Conclusions In our cohort, EEG background patterns outperformed ictal burden in predicting both neurodevelopmental outcomes and future epilepsy risk. Although background patterns are not directly modifiable, they provide powerful, early markers of brain injury severity, offering clinicians a valuable tool for prognostication and family counseling at a critical juncture in care.",

While decades of research have mapped cortical circuits of attention, the causal roles of deep hubs such as the basal ganglia and thalamus remain poorly understood in the healthy human brain. Objectives/Hypothesis: To test whether low intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) of two nodes in the basal ganglia-thalamic network, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the pulvinar, causally alters visual attention. We hypothesized that TUS-induced modulations in attentional performance would be site specific, reflecting distinct circuit functions. Results: Across sessions, focal TUS accelerated reaction time in a visual search task, indicating augmented attention. Reaction time improvements were observed after stimulation relative to baseline. A dissociation emerged across sites: both GPi and pulvinar enhanced reaction times, but pulvinar yielded more robust benefits for target present trials at peripheral eccentricities, and improved search efficiency in the same trials. Conclusions: These findings provide causal evidence that human attentional control can be steered at deep subcortical sites. TUS offers a practical approach for dissecting circuit level contributions to cognition and a potential noninvasive avenue for enhancing attention and other cognitive or affective functions.",
